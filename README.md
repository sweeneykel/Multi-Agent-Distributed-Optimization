# Multi-Agent-Distributed-Optimization
My technical contribution for final project EK505. Larger group project was to create a start-up for a robotics systems that solves a particular problem. Our group is investigating multi-robot systems in subterranean environments. 

Goal: Implement c-ADMM into code and simulate using different parameters or situations in a multi-robot system.
